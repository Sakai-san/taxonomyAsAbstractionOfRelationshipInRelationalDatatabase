nomy as abstraction of relationship in relational datatabase

# Introduction
In relational database tables are central. Table is central concept in relation database. A table gather sample havnig the same shape.

The issue is that the schema can grow and change over time and the amount of table and relationship can really grow. We are going to discuss here about an abstraction for generalizing the concept

# Data
Softwares manipulate data. Without data no need to create software.

# Schema
Let s have a very simple

# Relationship abstraction
Let s generalize the concept of relationship by using a concept called taxonomy. A taxonomy is an recursive abstraction for grouping entities having features in common.


# Maintenance
Business logic evolve over time. So the data model will. Let's suppose you now have a new requirement. Employee might work for two different Department simulaneously.


# Hierachical data
The abstraction we discuss also support hierachical data.


# Implementation
Let's assume you want all employee working in department A.
Let's assume you want all product tags as vehicule.


# Dynamic attribute
Generic modal can store data about employee, book, food, vehicule, account. Since the data might vary a lot, we need to find a way to create dynamic fields, like e.g. salary for employee. 


# Caveat
One issue is are not fully normalized. Sofware keep evolving and so do the data model. The abstraction shows cover a lot of use case and is quite adjustable to changes.
